## Performance Architecture

### Caching Strategy

```
Request → L1 Cache (Memory) → L2 Cache (Redis) → Database/Service
         ↑ 1-hour TTL        ↑ 24-hour TTL      ↑ Pooled Connections
         ↑ Sub-ms access     ↑ ~1ms access      ↑ Optimized queries
```

### Connection Pooling

- **PostgreSQL**: 10-50 connections with async management
- **Redis**: 10-50 connections with cluster support readiness
- **Qdrant**: HTTP client with connection reuse and keepalive

### Performance Targets

- **Throughput**: 200+ requests per second
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 80%+ for embedding and query operations
- **Response Time**: <100ms for cached queries, <500ms for uncached
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized with LRU eviction and compression

## Code Quality and Architecture

### Type Safety ✅

- All new code implements comprehensive type hints
- Proper async/await patterns throughout
- Error handling with structured logging

### Backward Compatibility ✅

- All existing API endpoints remain functional
- Legacy cache support during transition
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable

### Monitoring and Observability ✅

## Implementation Highlights

### Sophisticated Caching Logic

```python
# Multi-level cache with intelligent promotion/demotion
async def get_cached_data(key: str):
    # L1 (memory) - fastest access
    if data := await l1_cache.get(key):
        return data

    # L2 (Redis) - persistent cache
    if data := await l2_cache.get(key):
        await l1_cache.set(key, data)  # Promote to L1
        return data

    # Generate and cache at both levels
    data = await generate_data()
    await l1_cache.set(key, data)
    await l2_cache.set(key, data)
    return data
```

### Connection Pool Management

```python
# Centralized pool management with health monitoring
class DatabasePools:
    async def get_postgres_connection(self):
        async with self.postgres_pool.acquire() as conn:
            yield conn

    async def get_redis_client(self):
        return await self.redis_pool.get_connection()

    async def get_qdrant_client(self):
        return self.qdrant_client
```

### Performance Monitoring

```python
# Real-time metrics with compression and timing
@app.middleware("http")
async def performance_middleware(request, call_next):
    start_time = time.time()
    response = await call_next(request)

    # Add timing headers
    response.headers["X-Response-Time"] = f"{time.time() - start_time:.3f}s"

    # Apply compression
    if should_compress(response):
        response = await compress_response(response)

    return response
```
